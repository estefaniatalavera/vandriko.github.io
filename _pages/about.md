This is the web site of Vasilios Andrikopoulos, currently tenure tracking as an assistant professor in the [Software Engineering and Architecture](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/Main/HomePage) group of the University of Groningen, under the leadership of [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/). 

I am currently interested in the effect of the cloud computing paradigm on software architectures, both as the result of migrating existing systems to the cloud, and as the need for new or updated system design techniques for cloud native applications. The need for a new lifecycle for cloud-based applications is an example of this effort. I am also expanding my work towards the direction of systems of systems, with particular interest in emerging, ad hoc and potentially ephemeral systems as opposed to a priori designed ones.

My dissertation work addressed a number of topics affiliated with the need for managing the evolution of software services in a systematic manner. It entailed a versioning framework for service interfaces, a theory for service compatibility as an extension of type theory, compatibility checking algorithms implemented on service-oriented middleware, and the capability to generate consumer/provider-specific contracts that allow for additional flexibility in the evolution of either party.

As a postdoc, I worked on cloud-enabling service middleware, with a focus on issues of multi-tenancy awareness. I extended this work towards the migration of applications in the cloud looking beyond the issue of cloud provider selection, treating migration as a multi-dimensional problem. A major component of this effort is the development of the means to provide designers with cost estimations for operating their systems in the cloud under different deployment scenarios. It also seems that I co-authored one of the first papers on cloud native applications.

In addition to this web site, you can find (potentially slightly out of sync) information about me at my Software Engineering and Architecture [group page](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/VasiliosAndrikopoulos), my University of Groningen [page](http://www.rug.nl/staff/v.andrikopoulos/), and at the various social networks outlets on the sidebar of this page.
