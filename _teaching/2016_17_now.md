At RUG I am currently co-lecturing Web and Cloud Computing, and lecturing the Computer Architecture course. I also do tutoring for the Introduction to Computing Science course which provides a broad introduction to multiple aspects of Computer Science.

Web and Cloud Computing 
=======================

I am covering the Cloud Computing part of the course discussing cloud computing fundamentals, the current technological landscape, virtualization and resource management, and research issues related to cloud economics, migration of applications to the cloud, and cloud provider selection.

Computer Architecture
=====================

The course covers the key concepts, techniques, issues, and best practices in the design of a modern computer architecture. The subject material runs up the abstraction layers stack of computer systems. It also provides a short overview of basic concepts of computer networks.
