I was invited to talk at the sixth Dutch national symposium on software engineering ([SEN](http://www.sen-symposium.nl/)) organized by [VERSEN](https://versen.nl/), the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering. The talk revolved around my ongoing work on establishing the relation between software architecture and cost, which has become obvious through the adoption of cloud computing. You can find the slides of the talk [here](https://vandriko.github.io/files/2020_SEN_talk.pdf).
