During the ESOCC 2018 I presented our collaborative work with [Timon Back](http://www.timonback.de/) on benchmarking FaaS solutions. The microbenchmark we created for this work is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/timonback/faas-mubenchmark). 

You can find the slides of the talk [here](https://vandriko.github.io/files/2018_ESOCC_paper.pdf) and the full paper (author's copy) [here](https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/64559463/faas_mubenchmark.pdf).
