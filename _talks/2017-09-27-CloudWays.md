At the CloudWays 2017 workshop I talked about my take on how a CBA lifecycle should look like, including proposing a definition of CBAs that seems to be missing from the literature. You can find the slides of the talk **[here](https://vandriko.github.io/files/2017_Cloudways_presentation.pdf)** and the full paper (author's copy, while the workshop proceedings are in press) **[here](https://vandriko.github.io/files/2017_Cloudways_paper.pdf)**.
