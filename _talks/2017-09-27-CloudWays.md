At the CloudWays 2017 workshop on the CBA Lifecycle I talked about my take on how a CBA lifecycle should look like, including a definition of CBA that seems to be missing from the literature. You can find the slides of the talk [here](http://vandriko.github.io/files/2017_Cloudways_presentation.pdf) and the full paper (author's copy, while the workshop proceedings are in press) [here](http://vandriko.github.io/files/2017_Cloudways_paper.pdf).
